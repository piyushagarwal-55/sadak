 * Per-district cinematic grading presets for the render pipeline.

 * generic look slapped over all of them. Numbers here were tuned by eye
 * against lib/game/fx/preview.mjs renders, not derived analytically.
 *
 * The whole set targets a bright, vibrant, stylized look: saturated colour,
 * crisp shadows, and haze used only as a depth cue. See the house-style note

 *
 *   - Haze is a *depth cue*, not weather. Density stays at 0.0015-0.003 and
 *     the colour is always a high-value neighbour of that district's sky, so
 *     distant buildings recede without the frame going milky.
 *   - Grain and chromatic aberration are 0 everywhere. Both were reading as
 *     dirt rather than as film character. The uniforms and the shader
 *     branches are deliberately kept alive so a future gritty district can
 *     dial them back up without a shader change.
 *   - No gain channel ever drops below 1.0. Pulling a channel down to fake a
 *     colour cast is what made the old grades look washed; the cast comes
 *     from `temperature` and from the district palette instead.
 *   - Vignette is 0.10-0.16 at radius 0.78+ — enough to keep the eye centred,
 *     not enough to read as a dark border.
 *
 * District identity is carried by hue and by the palettes in districts.ts,
 * never by desaturation.

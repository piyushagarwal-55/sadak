/**
 * Real building geometry.
 *
 * The previous version was a single textured box, which is why no amount of
 * post-processing made the city read as a city. What sells a street is depth
 * you can see the light catch: recessed window reveals, floor ledges that cast
 * a line of shadow, balconies that break the silhouette, and a ground floor at
 * human scale with shopfronts.
 *
 * All of it is merged into a handful of BufferGeometries per building, so a
 * facade with two hundred parts still costs about three draw calls. Without
 * merging this would add ~40 meshes per building and the city would die.
